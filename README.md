GrocerFree is an Android and Windows 8.1 app (and website) created to help reduce food cost and food waste, by connecting people to local and seasonal produce. Traditions of sharing within communities and neighbourhoods has decreased, and GrocerFree aims to provide locations of locally grown produce available for urban foraging and harvest.

With global food prices rising quickly, backyard to table eating is the future to create sustainable and low impact cities.  Food transportation, especially from overseas, contributes significantly to rising food costs, along with wasting energy resources.

GrocerFree identifies your current location and pinpoints produce around your city that is available to gather. These can be filtered by season. Fruit and vegetables are easily identified by their marker icons.
